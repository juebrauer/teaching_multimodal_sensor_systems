// DEMO order:
//
// 1. show demo with code/parameters as is
//
// 2. Importance of particle diversity:
//    deactivate USE_NOISE_IN_PREDICTION_STEP
//    observe how important noise is in the prediction
//    step to keep diversity
//
// 3. Tracking in the case of heavy noise
//    --> Importance of resampling:
//    (i)   set NR_OF_COMPLETELY_WRONG_MEASUREMENTS from
//          1 to 20 --> observe demo
//    (ii)  set NR_OF_COMPLETELY_WRONG_MEASUREMENTS from
//          1 to 50 --> observe demo
//    (iii) set RESAMPLING on --> observe demo
//    (iv)  set POPULATION_SIZE from 1000 to 2000 --> observe
//
//    This is an impressive behavior of the particle filter and a
//    prototypical example of how sensor fusion over time using many
//    noisy measurements can help to estimate state vectors!
//   
//    Even in situations where we have two times more wrong than correct
//    (= : noisy, but near to real spaceship parts) measurements,
//    the particle filter algorithm allows us to estimate the spaceship
//    locations!
//
//    An important question is : why is this possible?
//    It is the interplay between the prediction and the
//    correction-by-measurement step and the more consistent behavior
//    of measurements near to real spaceship parts:
//    if a particle is near to one of the 20 random measurements,
//    it might follow it, but in the next step, it will follow with
//    a high chance another measurement.
//    In contrast, particles near to �real� (even if they are noisy)
//    measurements, will have a high chance to follow this spaceship
//    part, since a new noisy measurement will appear near to the
//    spaceship part in the next step. And the prediction step helps
//    to stay in the neighborhood of the spaceship part even if it
//    moves away, since we move the particle in the prediction step into
//    the direction of the assumed movement.
//
// 4. Particle relocation experiments
//    --> Importance of resampling
//    (i) set TEST_RELOCATION_OF_PARTICLES true
//        and RESAMPLING false
//   (ii) set TEST_RELOCATION_OF_PARTICLES true
//        and RESAMPLING true
